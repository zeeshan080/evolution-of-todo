## Prompt

Execute /sp.plan to create the implementation plan for the Phase I Console Todo App based on the feature specification.

## Response snapshot

Created complete implementation plan with Phase 0 research and Phase 1 design artifacts:

**plan.md** - Main implementation plan with:
- Technical context (Python 3.13+, pytest, in-memory storage)
- Constitution check table (all 6 principles: PASS)
- Project structure for `phase-1-console/` folder
- Module separation: models.py, manager.py, ui.py, main.py

**research.md** - Technical decisions:
1. Python dataclass for Task model
2. List-based in-memory storage in TaskManager
3. Validation at UI boundary with exceptions from manager
4. While loop with numbered menu for console interface
5. KeyboardInterrupt handling for Ctrl+C
6. pytest with fixtures for TDD

**data-model.md** - Entity definition:
- Task entity with 5 fields (id, title, description, completed, created_at)
- Validation rules for title (1-200 chars) and description (max 1000)
- State transition diagrams for completion and lifecycle

**quickstart.md** - Developer guide:
- Setup instructions with UV
- Usage examples for all 6 menu options
- TDD workflow example

**contracts/task-manager-interface.md** - Internal API:
- 8 public methods on TaskManager class
- Error contract (ValueError, KeyError)
- Usage example and future evolution notes

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete technical plan ready for task breakdown
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (planning documentation)
- 📁 Files: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/task-manager-interface.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks for task breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan aligns with all 6 Constitution principles; abstracted TaskManager supports future persistence

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check PASSED (6/6 principles)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with /sp.tasks
