## Prompt

Create feature specification for Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App with interactive menu interface. Include user stories for all 5 core features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) plus navigation/exit, with prioritized acceptance scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and edge cases.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification with:

1. **6 User Stories (P1-P6)**:
   - P1: View All Tasks (foundational capability)
   - P2: Add New Task (primary input mechanism)
   - P3: Mark Task Complete/Incomplete (core feedback loop)
   - P4: Update Task (refinement capability)
   - P5: Delete Task (cleanup feature)
   - P6: Navigate Menu and Exit (interface handling)

2. **13 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-013)**:
   - Interactive numbered menu with 6 options
   - Task CRUD operations with validation
   - Auto-generated sequential IDs
   - Input validation with helpful error messages
   - In-memory storage with exit warning

3. **8 Success Criteria (SC-001 to SC-008)**:
   - All technology-agnostic and measurable
   - Time-based UX metrics (add task < 30s, view < 2s)
   - 100% invalid input handling
   - First-use intuitiveness

4. **Key Entity (Task)**:
   - id, title (1-200 chars), description (optional, max 1000), completed, created_at

5. **6 Edge Cases** identified with expected behavior

6. **Quality Checklist** - All 12 items passed validation

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (specification document)
- 📁 Files: specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md, specs/001-console-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec follows constitution principles; technology-agnostic success criteria ensure flexibility

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist PASSED (12/12 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with /sp.plan
