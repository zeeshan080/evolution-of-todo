## Prompt

Execute /sp.tasks to generate actionable task breakdown for the Phase I Console Todo App based on the implementation plan and feature specification.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 99 tasks organized into 10 phases:

**Phase Structure**:
1. **Setup (5 tasks)**: Project initialization, UV setup, package structure
2. **Foundational (8 tasks)**: Task model and TaskManager core (TDD)
3. **US1 View (13 tasks)**: View all tasks - MVP starting point
4. **US2 Add (15 tasks)**: Add new task with validation
5. **US3 Complete (10 tasks)**: Toggle task completion status
6. **US4 Update (12 tasks)**: Update task title/description
7. **US5 Delete (10 tasks)**: Delete task with confirmation
8. **US6 Menu/Exit (12 tasks)**: Navigation and clean exit
9. **Integration (7 tasks)**: Main loop wiring
10. **Polish (7 tasks)**: Final validation and documentation

**Task Distribution by User Story**:
| Story | Tests | Implementation | Total |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------|
| US1 | 7 | 6 | 13 |
| US2 | 8 | 7 | 15 |
| US3 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| US4 | 7 | 5 | 12 |
| US5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| US6 | 6 | 6 | 12 |

**Key Features**:
- TDD enforced: Tests MUST be written first (Red phase) per Constitution Principle III
- [P] markers for parallelizable tasks (different files, no dependencies)
- [US#] labels for user story traceability
- Clear checkpoints after each phase for validation
- Incremental delivery strategy (MVP = US1 View)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 99 actionable tasks ready for /sp.implement
- 🧪 Tests: Test tasks included for all user stories (TDD mandatory)
- 📁 Files: specs/001-console-todo-app/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute tasks with TDD
- 🧠 Reflection: Task organization by user story enables independent testing and incremental delivery

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASSED (all tasks follow checklist format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with /sp.implement
