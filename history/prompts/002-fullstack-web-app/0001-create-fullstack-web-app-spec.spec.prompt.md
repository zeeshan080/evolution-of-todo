## Prompt

User triggered /sp.specify to create the feature specification for Phase II of the Evolution of Todo hackathon. The feature is a Full-Stack Web Todo Application with user authentication, RESTful API, and persistent storage - transforming the Phase I console app into a multi-user web application.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification with:
- 8 user stories (P1-P4 priority) covering registration, login, task CRUD, and logout
- 15 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015)
- 8 measurable success criteria
- Edge cases documented
- Key entities defined (User, Task)
- Assumptions and out-of-scope items clearly stated
- Quality checklist created and all items passed

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - Complete specification ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: N/A - Specification phase
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec created without clarification markers - reasonable defaults applied for auth method, session duration, and other details

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual checklist validation - PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
