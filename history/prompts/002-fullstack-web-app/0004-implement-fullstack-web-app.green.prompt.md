## Prompt

start implement using /sp.implement commands and for neondb here is the url of db DATABASE_URL=postgresql://zeeshan080:zqm3PNQoZFL8@ep-divine-sun-a5fzzeca-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/evolution-of-todo-db?sslmode=require use the agents u can even run in parallel if required

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the complete Full-Stack Web Todo Application (Phase 2) using parallel agent execution.

### Implementation Summary

**103 tasks completed across 11 phases:**

| Phase | Description | Tasks | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Setup | T001-T009 | ✓ |
| 2 | Foundational (Database, Auth, Backend, Frontend Core) | T010-T034 | ✓ |
| 3 | US1 Registration | T035-T040 | ✓ |
| 4 | US2 Login | T041-T046 | ✓ |
| 5 | US3 View Tasks | T047-T056 | ✓ |
| 6 | US4 Add Task | T057-T065 | ✓ |
| 7 | US5 Update Task | T066-T075 | ✓ |
| 8 | US6 Mark Complete | T076-T083 | ✓ |
| 9 | US7 Delete Task | T084-T091 | ✓ |
| 10 | US8 Logout | T092-T095 | ✓ |
| 11 | Polish | T096-T103 | ✓ |

### Key Deliverables

**Frontend (Next.js 16):**
- Landing page with auth flow
- Registration and login pages
- Dashboard with task list
- TaskForm, TaskList, TaskItem components
- LogoutButton component
- Better Auth integration (server + client)
- Drizzle ORM schema and client

**Backend (FastAPI):**
- Complete REST API for tasks CRUD
- JWT verification via JWKS
- SQLModel for database access
- 46 passing pytest tests
- Health check endpoint

**Infrastructure:**
- Neon PostgreSQL database with tables
- Docker Compose for deployment
- Comprehensive documentation

### Agents Used

Executed 10 specialized agents in parallel batches:
1. database-expert (T010-T019)
2. auth-expert (T020-T026)
3. backend-expert (T027-T030)
4. frontend-expert (T031-T034, T051-T056)
5. Full-stack agents for CRUD operations

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete full-stack web application ready for deployment
- 🧪 Tests: 46 backend tests passing (auth, health, tasks CRUD)
- 📁 Files: 50+ files created across frontend and backend
- 🔁 Next prompts: Deploy to production, add more features
- 🧠 Reflection: Parallel agent execution significantly accelerated implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Minor dependency issues resolved during setup
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tests PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Parallel agent execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test real auth flow end-to-end
