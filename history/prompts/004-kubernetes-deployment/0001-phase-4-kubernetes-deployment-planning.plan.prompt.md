## Prompt

User executed the `/sp.plan` command to create an implementation plan for Phase 4: Local Kubernetes Deployment.

The specification requires deploying the Phase 3 Todo Chatbot application (Next.js 16 frontend + FastAPI backend with AI agents) to a local Minikube Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts, with proper health checks, ConfigMap/Secret separation, and AI DevOps tools integration (kubectl-ai, kagent, Docker AI/Gordon).

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan at `/home/dell/evolution-of-todo/specs/004-kubernetes-deployment/plan.md` with the following structure:

**Summary**: Deploy Phase 3 application to Minikube with Helm charts, using monolithic chart structure, Minikube Docker daemon for images, NodePort for frontend (30300), ClusterIP for backend (8000).

**Technical Context**:
- Languages: Python 3.13+ (backend), TypeScript/Node.js 22+ (frontend)
- Infrastructure: Minikube 1.32+, Kubernetes 1.28+, Helm 3.x, Docker 24+
- AI DevOps Tools: kubectl-ai, kagent, Docker AI (Gordon)
- Storage: External Neon PostgreSQL + Cloudflare R2 (no in-cluster storage)
- Testing: pytest, Jest, Shell scripts for deployment verification
- Performance: Pods ready <2min, frontend loads <5sec, health probe <1sec

**Constitution Check**: ✅ PASS with adaptations
- All 6 principles reviewed and validated
- TDD adapted for infrastructure: "test-deploy-verify" workflow
- Single violation justified: Infrastructure testing uses deployment verification rather than unit tests

**Project Structure**:
- Existing: backend/, frontend/, docker-compose.yml (Phase 3 - untouched)
- New: k8s/, helm/todo-app/, scripts/k8s/, docs/kubernetes/
- Helm chart: Monolithic with modular templates (frontend/, backend/, shared/)
- Documentation: research.md, config-contracts.md, quickstart.md

**Phase 0: Research Tasks** (8 tasks documented):
1. Helm Chart Best Practices for Microservices
2. Minikube Docker Daemon Integration
3. Kubernetes Health Probes Configuration
4. Service-to-Service Communication in Kubernetes
5. kubectl-ai Capabilities and Usage
6. kagent Features and Health Checks
7. Docker AI (Gordon) for Image Optimization
8. Secrets Management in Helm

**Phase 1: Design Artifacts** (7 deliverables defined):
1. Helm Values Schema (values.yaml, values-dev.yaml)
2. ConfigMap Contract (non-sensitive config)
3. Secret Contract (sensitive credentials with validation)
4. Deployment Contracts (frontend & backend specs)
5. Service Contracts (NodePort & ClusterIP)
6. Quick Start Guide (quickstart.md)
7. Agent Context Update (CLAUDE.md updated)

**ADR Candidates Identified** (3 architectural decisions):
1. Monolithic Helm Chart vs. Umbrella Chart
2. Minikube Docker Daemon vs. External Registry
3. NodePort vs. Ingress for Frontend Exposure

**Agent Context Update**: Successfully ran `update-agent-context.sh claude` to add Phase 4 technologies to CLAUDE.md

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive architectural plan created for Phase 4 Kubernetes deployment with clear technical decisions, constitution compliance, and phased approach
- 🧪 Tests: Agent context update verified successful, no infrastructure tests run yet (Phase 0 research pending)
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md (655 lines), updated CLAUDE.md with Phase 4 tech stack
- 🔁 Next prompts: Execute Phase 0 research tasks (8 research areas), then Phase 1 design (7 artifacts), then `/sp.tasks` for implementation breakdown, consider `/sp.adr` for 3 ADR candidates
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan successfully bridges infrastructure/DevOps requirements with SDD methodology by adapting TDD to "test-deploy-verify" workflow appropriate for Kubernetes manifests

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - planning phase completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check: PASS (6/6 principles validated with 1 justified adaptation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 0 research with kubectl-ai and kagent capability analysis to validate AI DevOps tool integration feasibility
